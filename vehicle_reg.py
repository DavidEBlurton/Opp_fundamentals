# Task 1: Vehicle Registration System

# Problem Statement: Create a Python class Vehicle with attributes registration_number, type, and owner. Implement a method update_owner to change the vehicle's owner. Then, create a few instances of Vehicle and demonstrate changing the owner.
# Code Example: Provide a basic structure for the Vehicle class without methods.
#     class Vehicle:
#         def __init__(self, reg_num, type, owner):
#             self.registration_number = reg_num
#             self.type = type
#             self.owner = owner
# Expected Outcome: Completion of the Vehicle class with the update_owner method and a demonstration script showing the creation of Vehicle objects and updating their owners.

class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, registration_number, model, owner):
        self.registration_number = registration_number
        self.type = model
        self.owner = owner
    
    def update_owner(self, new_owner):
        self.owner = new_owner
        print(f"Owner updated to {self.owner}")
